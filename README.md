# H1 **Web portfolio**
## H2 The Why
### H3 The reason why I chose to create my portfolio this way is because I have an adoration for the arts whether that was plastic, visual or even martial arts. All is welcome in my eyes.

## H2 Trust the Process
### H3 It was a challenge for me to create this, as it should be. However it was not the detriment. Thinking mindfully as I worked on this, reminded me that when we want to achieve something, not feel the pressure of the future or past, we simply think on the present actions.
